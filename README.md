# En-GB-Joomla-2.5-Language-pack
En-GB Joomla 2.5 Language pack. It is en-AU English (Australia) language pack, where en-AU replaced to en-GB.
If you are stupid like me and delete default en-GB language pack and after this plugins and components don't work right, you can fix this problem with this en-GB pack. 
I don't find en-GB language on joomla site and remake new from en-AU language pack. Thanks for Joomla Community.
